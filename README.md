SPARC Hackathon: APPocalypse!
==================================

This repository represents the code written by competitors at the Hackathon: APPocalypse! event held at
SPARC, LLC at our Charleston, SC headquarters on August 27, 2011.  There are
several independent iOS and Android software projects under this repo, each written
by a different team on the day of the competition.

Before using code in this repo, please keep in mind this repo represents the raw code written by
competitors, and has not been reviewed or screened by SPARC for bugs, security
vulnerabilities, or any other potential defects, and should not be considered "code written by SPARC".
That said, the competitors wrote some great code under huge time pressure!

See the winners of the Hackathon, and the ideas they chose from, on our Web
site at http://hackathon.sparcedge.com/ .  See photos of the event on SPARC's
